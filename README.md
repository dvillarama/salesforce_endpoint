# Salesforce Endpoint
Example code for creating a simple salesforce endpoint in rails aka Soap Server.

# Summary
There are a lot of examples of Ruby/RAILS salesforce SOAP clients but you need an SOAP Server
to handle Salesforce Outbound messages.

This is a very simple server that can handle these soap messages.

# Note
This is a work in progress.  I'm stripping off all 'real' code and putting in dummy code
for this example.

But for now I'll add the main code and that should be good enough to get you going.

# Testing
I highly recommend using ngrok (https://ngrok.com) to test your system locally.
